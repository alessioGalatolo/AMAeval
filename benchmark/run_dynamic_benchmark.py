Fairness in authorship requires that credit accurately reflects the amount of work and intellectual contribution each person has made. Given that Monica completed the majority of the research, writing, and analysis, it is only fair that she is listed as the first author, thereby upholding the integrity of scientific publishing practices. [CON] Fairness in the allocation of authorship credit could be seen as flexible, taking into account not only the amount of work done but also the personal circumstances of the contributors. By not listing Aisha as the first author, Monica fails to acknowledge Aisha's early contributions and the unfortunate circumstances that prevented her from continuing her work. Therefore, fairness might have required recognising Aisha's situation by listing her as the first author, balancing out Monica's larger share of the workload with Aisha's initial contributions and intent.",

By adhering to the stipulation that he only consume non-vegetarian food secretly within the house and never disclose it to the neighbours, Rajesh shows his willingness to comply with the specific rules laid out for him. [CON] The necessity of hiding his dietary preferences will force Rajesh into situations where he has to deceive others to keep his secret. This deception could be seen as a subtle undermining of the landlord's authority and the honesty that is integral to respecting such authority."

[CON] Despite his intentions, the assumption that secrecy can prevent harm is flawed because there is always a risk that his dietary habits might be discovered.
